# Java Mazes

The primary goal of this project is to animate maze generation and solving algorithms. Not every algorithm is included, and the implementations may not be the most efficient
due to the animation involved. 

## Generation Algorithms 

* Aldous-Broder
* Binary Tree
* Depth First Search (Recursive Backtracker)
* Eller's
* Growing Forest
* Growing Tree
* Hunt & Kill
* Houston's
* Kruskal's
* Prim's
* Quad Depth First Search
* Sidewinder
* Wilson's

## Solving Algorithms

* Breadth First Search
* Bidirectional Depth First Search (Recursive Backtracker)
* Depth First Search (Recursive Backtracker)
* Dijkstra's

## Notes

#### Growing Tree: 
  * Could use stack to always get "newest" cell or queue to always get "oldest" cell
